we re all trying
to tell who s lying
and choose just what to believe
we re second nature
to placate ya
i wear my emotions on a sleeve
i always try my best to put the rest to second guessers and i m
well aware that misery loves company
instead i m trying to run around on things that we can t settle on
why don t we stop and see the person standing there
and
just because it feels good
doesn t make it real to me
authenticity
is what i need
cause everyone s a liar when they talk to me
i can t believe
just anything
when you make it up so easily
why you lying
so much denying
what i see on tv and what i read and even what they re writing
we come to believe these lies so comfortably
we tend to propagate opinions so recklessly
and it s a fine line
that separates the screen from reality
a meme is just a meme
and i feel like we should know this but i don t believe we do
we ve got to keep on trekking
keep our eyes on what we know is true
just because it feels good
doesn t make it real to me
authenticity
is what i need
cause everyone s a liar when they talk to me
i can t believe
just anything
when you make it up so easily
authenticity
is my plea
cause everyone s a liar when they talk to me
your honesty
is what i breathe
so tell me you ll be good to me
when it feels surreal so real
it makes me wanna believe do you believe
what i really need is authenticity
authenticity
is my plea
cause everyone s a liar when they talk to me
your honesty
is what i breathe
so tell me you ll be good to me
just because it feels good
doesn t make it real to me tell me you ll be good to me
doesn t make it real to me tell me you ll be good to me

summer s over
losing yourself
find a purpose
no one noticed
so insecure
such a good actor
but you passed the bong and failed as director
you re bound to repeat you re bound to repeat it
i told myself to today
i had to move away
what coast should i be on can i afford the rent
in your home i could stay
music we tried to play
i had to get a job my inspiration s spent
if i can only find the reminders of what i expected this to be
however i ll defined
what were the things you said that got me excited
spastically scratch my head spastically scratch my head
the only way to find our vision
is to overcome our indecision
open up myopic eyes
the details that paralyze seem so small
realize that our ambitions may take a long time
it s been harder than i planned
but i need to finish before i start again
build your own bicycle
go for a water ride
sing in the studio
send a rough mix to ry
revise the schedule
make something beautiful
strengthen abdominals
strengthen abdominals
the only way to find our vision
is to overcome our indecision
open up myopic eyes
the details that paralyze seem so small
realize that our ambitions may take a long time
what happens when you hurt somebody
what happens when you hurt somebody you cared for
what happens when you break somebody
what happens when you break somebody you cared for
spank out on love
what happens when you hurt somebody
what happens when you hurt somebody you cared for
what happens when you break somebody
what happens when you break somebody you cared for
spank out on love
what happens when love is wrong
no more i m sorrys
no more never happen agains
no more this is how much you mean to me
no more just the end
i thought i knew myself this time
i think there s someone here
hello
i think there s someone here
hello
i can t help it
my mutations
new creations
inside me that i can t control
little creature
you heal me
but you kill me
fresh in absurdity
i try my best to keep it out
fight for control is painful
i try my best to keep it out
they say to take this pain pill
i try my best to keep it out
this genesis is sinful
i try my best to keep it out
this isn t just a pimple
hide away
my decay
hunker down
lurk in shade
it will pass
and be okay
the rain won t come for another day
better keep it down just a little bit
better keep it down just a little bit
better keep it down just a little bit
or people think you talking to yourself
ah hell they a ready think yo crazy
how bout when you birth this baby
like arnold a junior maybe
a scaly you with a hue of gravy
i think that someone s here
there s someone here besides myself
a creature s void of fear
that speaks to me and no one else
it lurks behind my mirror
a flowing beard and golden vest
it ties into my shoes
and steal the beats inside my chest
i try my best to keep it out
i feel the pressure mounting
i try my best to keep it out
my hair is going rotten
i try my best to keep it out
i can t control its fang filled mouth
or its willingness to breed this loneliness in me
deep in a crack of each man s heart
lurks a strange beast waiting in the dark
it jumps to life with no control
and tears to bits what should be whole
ooh
hide away
my decay
hunker down
lurk in shade
it will pass
and be okay
the rain won t come for another day

they say the world s a mess
they say we cause our own stress
they say we re better off if we did it their way
they say our problems are our faults
they say that it s not theirs at all
they have the money
but they don t have the time to pay attention
and we got a lot to learn
that no one s gonna teach us but our own
we surround ourselves with friends
there s no more time to pretend
let s do it right
let s do it better
cause we don t need them
today
we re gonna show the world exactly what we re made of
tonight
we re gonna celebrate the party is just getting started
they say it s just a phase
they say our feelings will change
they say we re just doing this for attention
they say that we ll go all to hell
just for being ourselves
well the hell them cause we won t be things that we re not
and we got time to grow
before we come into our own
we get to choose our own beliefs
make up our own families
we ll do it right
let s do it better
cause we don t need them
today
we re gonna show the world exactly what we re made of
tonight
we re gonna celebrate the party is just getting started
they say we shouldn t be sad
and they always get mad
when they can t figure out why we re so depressed
so they fill us with pills
and say our feelings aren t real
but the lives we lose are real to us
so we have to change
the way that we care for each other
we gotta learn to lift up one another
it s all up to us so the love is a must
we ll do it right
let s do it better
so we can show them
today
we re gonna show the world exactly what we re made of
and tonight
we re gonna celebrate the party is just getting started
today
we re gonna show the world exactly what we re made of
tonight
we re gonna celebrate the party is just getting started
what they say can t stop what we do
if we go all the way
what they say can t stop what we do
if we go all the way
don t get up
sit down
just relax
and be calm
when finally the pain is gone
i can convince myself there s nothing wrong
that this conspiracy consists of no one else
beside myself
why try suicide when i sabotage my mind all the time
i cry blur my eyes say it will be fine but i lie
why am i
turning away from what i should be
when all that i need has already come true
i ve run away
trying to feed the courage to bleed
excuses they seem the only escape to
run away
wash out the stink that clings to me
cause people smell though they barely breathe
i m standing poised against their angry sea
but i drown in my own mediocrity
how can i decide to stand against the tide
when all have died that tried
curled up in me room
waiting for the signs of impending doom
ka boom
now that i see just what i m to be
to fulfill these dreams they ve always deemed see through
i ve run away
trying to feed the courage to bleed
excuses succeed to truths that entreat to
run away
you say you want to change something do you
don t want your world this way
then whatcha gonna do do do
wash out the stink that clings to me
cause people smell though they barely breathe
i m standing poised against their angry sea
but i drown in my own mediocrity
how can i decide to stand against the tide
when all have died that tried
curled up in me room
waiting for the signs of impending doom
ka boom
