show the world exactly what we're made of\nTonight\nWe're gonna celebrate the party is just getting started\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say we shouldn't be sad\nAnd they always get mad\nWhen they can't figure out why we're so depressed\nSo they fill us with pills\nAnd say our feelings aren't real\nBut the lives we lose are real to us\nSo we have to change\nThe way that we care for each other\nWe gotta learn to lift up one another\nIt's all up to us so the love is a must\nWe'll do it right\nLet's do it better\nSo we can show them\n\n[Chorus]\nToday\nWe're gonna show the world exactly what we're made of\nAnd Tonight\nWe're gonna celebrate the party is just getting started\nToday\nWe're gonna show the world exactly what we're made of\nTonight\nWe're gonna celebrate the party is just getting started\n\n[Outro]\nWhat they say can't stop what we do\nIf we go all the way\nWhat they say can't stop what we do\nIf we go all the way"}, {"url": "https://genius.com/Planet-booty-runaway-lyrics",

wrong\nThat this conspiracy consists of no one else\nBeside myself\n\nWhy try suicide when I sabotage my mind all the time?\nI cry, blur my eyes, say it will be fine but I lie\nWhy am I\u2026\n\nTurning away from what I should be\nWhen all that I need has already come true?\nI\u2019ve run away\nTrying to feed the courage to bleed\nExcuses they seem the only escape to\nRun away\n\nWash out the stink that clings to me\n\u2018Cause people smell though they barely breathe\nI\u2019m standing poised against their angry sea\nBut I drown in my own mediocrity\n\nHow can I decide to stand against the tide\nWhen all have died that tried?\nCurled up in me room\nWaiting for the signs of impending doom\nKa-boom\n\nNow that I see just what I\u2019m to be\nTo fulfill these dreams they\u2019ve always deemed see through\nI\u2019ve run away\nTrying to feed the courage to bleed\nExcuses succeed to truths that entreat to\nRun away\n\nYou say you want to change something do you?\nDon\u2019t want your world this way?\nThen whatcha gonna do, do, do?\n\nWash out the stink that clings to me\n\u2018Cause people smell though they barely breathe\nI\u2019m standing poised against their angry sea\nBut I drown in my own mediocrity\n\nHow can I decide to stand against the tide\nWhen all have died that tried?\nCurled up in me room\nWaiting for the signs of impending

believe my eyes look at the size a huge crack in the mountain side\nWipidi wild water rafting ride\nThe pull it's strong and my heart just pumps bunny on the path\nExplorer pimp to find the secret of the mountain limbs give me that\nFeeling of goose pimperlies bramberry\nRock nippa nippa nipplerlees pearls of sweat run down\nDown the cheecks i meant a little\nSteam meets with the creek salty crystal\nWith da sugar-hill whistle\nHoney-bee make my mind sizzle\nLookin' for da cake hole drizle drizle\n\nI feel one with the whole of the cookoo monka mountain fold (x2)\n\nFrogga:\nLick dem
